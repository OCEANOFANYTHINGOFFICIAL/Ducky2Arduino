DuckyScript -> Arduino converter/compiler + HID mouse emulation.
```diff

- DEPENDENCY: https://github.com/NicoHood/HID (*IMPORTANT!*)

```
Download HID-Project from: https://github.com/NicoHood/HID/archive/master.zip and add it to Arduino Library.
###  If You Got Any Problems With The Keyboard Layout, (If You Don't Have A QWERTY Keyboard) Then Use The Library That I created:
*  >  [LocalKeyboard.js: repository](https://github.com/OCEANOFANYTHINGOFFICIAL/LocalKeyboard.js)
*  >  [LocalKeyboard.js: Website](https://OCEANOFANYTHINGOFFICIAL.github.io/LocalKeyboard.js)
###  If You Don't Want To Use The Mouse Emulation Then Use:
*  >[DuckDuino](https://github.com/OCEANOFANYTHINGOFFICIAL/DuckDuino)
###  NOTE: You should update the Arduino IDE to the latest version for better cross-platform compatibility! (Or use the Arduino Create Web IDE)
###  Ducky Payload Scripts: [Official Ducky Scripts](https://github.com/hak5darren/USB-Rubber-Ducky/wiki/Duckyscript)
The Commands Are Basically The Same Except That You Can Simulate A Mouse With DuckDuino Like So:
"MOUSEMOVE xPos,yPos,wheelPos" For Positioning And "MOUSECLICK left/right/middle" For Clicks.
